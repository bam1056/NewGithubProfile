# NewGithubProfile
This project was designed to familiarize students with the use of SASS and React in designing webpages, as well as to demonstrate how an API can be queried for information that can be utilized by a program to create content. This is intended to be an exact (or as close as reasonably possible) replica of a students GitHub profile landing page. 

Cosmetically the site should be essentially identical. Functionality for the moment besides some external links will mostly be relegated to a future revision of this project.
